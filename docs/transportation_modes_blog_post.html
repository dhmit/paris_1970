<h2>
Evolution of Transportation Modes in Paris
</h2>

<p>
After the French Revolution in the 18th century, Paris experienced a huge shift in its urban planning policy starting in the "Second Empire" of Napoleon III which was aimed at reducing congestion in the city and replacing the old medieval network of narrow streets with wide boulevards that provided space for Parisian stores to flourish and be more accessible. Under the guidance of Baron Georges-Eugene Hassmann, the "Second Empire reforms" gave the city a lot of breathing room through a network of bold boulevards that acted in a similar way to a vein network in a leaf dissipating the congestion from the city center into outlying roads and later making it more accessible for Parisian families to start owning automobiles. This was a first step in making it easier for Parisian families to own automobiles. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, in the 20th century, Paris experienced a shift towards encouraging the owning of individual houses instead of building large apartment complexes. Specifically in 1969, the Minister of Infrastructure and Housing, Albin Chalandon, decided to modify the city policy to make it more accessible to own houses in Paris. This indirectly helped increase the use of cars in Paris as families not only had the wide boulevards where they can drive their cars easily, but also less population density giving them more parking space and further making it easier to own a car in Paris. These patterns can be clearly seen in many of the squares involved in the 1970 photography contest studied in "This is Paris in 1970."
</p>

<p>
Below are some analyses of some map squares from the 1970 photography contest from the data set to show how car usage in Paris outnumbered other forms of transportation, especially bikes.

Map Square 56 is located in the northern perimeter of the city of Paris. The overall street and road network of Map Square 56 has remained consistent over time, preserving its most distinguishable feature of a plaza at which several roads intersect.  As of today, these roads support several bus routes which bring commuters to and from the plaza as well as a growing cycling network. This was not always the case, as mobility and transportation in Paris  had heavily centered around automobiles. The shift in focus on and from cars over time is made evident through planning differences observed between the photographs of Map Square 56 submitted to “C'était Paris en 1970” and photographs of the same area today.

The position of the plaza at the intersection helps facilitate the social life of the streets. In the picture below on the right, outdoor dining venues and markets encourage pedestrians to interact. The boundaries of the pedestrian crosswalks are dotted and compared to the bold stroke and striped fills crosswalks have today. Additionally, the roads are cobblestoned instead of smoothly paved. While pedestrian spaces existed, support for the pedestrian experience was lacking. In the image below on the left, pedestrians resort to walking on the roads with cars.

In addition to the wide boulevards and standard-sized roads made for automobiles, automobiles were also the focus of narrow sidewalks and alleyways. Very narrow sidewalks which force pedestrians into walking down the roads meant for cars – roads that happen to nearly make up the entire width of the street as pictured below.

<h2>
Map Square #112
</h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col col-sm-6">
    <p>
This map square had an intersection of multiple wide boulevards that were developed during the Haussmannization of Paris. These boulevards provided a lot of space to facilitate the usage of cars in Paris, and this high usage was clearly demonstrated by the strong presence of multiple cars in a large number of the photos that were associated with this square. Some of these pictures are shown below.

<p>
As demonstrated by these pictures, cars were the dominant form of transportation during that time and the abundance of space for driving and parking demonstrated by the pictures of the wide boulevards above definitely demonstrates that. Although cars were dominant, the city also had other modes of transportation that were still significantly used, mainly buses, motorcycles, and bikes. These modes will later become an important consideration for the Parisian government when they try to replace the high car usage in the present day with more environmentally-friendly transportation options.

<h2>
Map Square 55
</h2>

<p>
This map square is situated in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. In 1970, it had one of the highest numbers of cars and bicycles photographed in it (35 cars and 4 bikes) and this is clear from the photos above. It is at the intersection of major roads - Boulevard Ney and Bd Ornano. Today, its status as a busy part of the city stiAccording to Google Maps, these roads currently have bike-friendly roads, trails, and dedicated lanes stretching across the entire square, though from looking at the street view of some of the roads, I didn’t spot many cars.

<p>
Traffic levels are extremely high on these roads though, which is understandable because today the area has around 5 hotels, 3 sports centers, and a lot of restaurants which calls for a lot of cars. There is also a metro station, many bus stops, and tram access on Boulevard Ney.

        After the 1970s, both the overall number of cars and the number of cars per household increased consistently until it reached the modern-day levels. Overall, this increase was seen throughout France, but at different rates depending on the landscape of the area in which the growth was seen. For example, car ownership increased at a higher rate in rural areas compared to city centers as demonstrated by figures 3 and 5. Although car ownership in city centers did not increase as fast as rural areas, it still experienced a consistent growth trend in the decades following the 1970s which was significantly facilitated by the Haussmannization process in Paris and similar urban planning trends throughout city centers all over France.

The increased car usage in France, and especially in densely populated city centers like Paris, took a huge toll on the environment and air cleanliness as shown by the high levels of fine small fine particles which especially peak along major roads and boulevards like the ones which were laid down during the Haussmannization of Paris. To help reduce the effects of that pollution, the Parisian government is implementing a ban on most cars in the city by 2024. Transportation patterns will also shift to being ‘less car-centric and more cycling friendly’. According to a world air map on plume labs, as of 2022, Paris is moderately polluted at levels that are higher than the yearly limit set by the WHO. This ban aims to reduce congestion and pollution levels in the city, in preparation for its hosting of the 2024 Olympic games. Between 1970 and 2022, the urban planning strategies imposed on the city have completely shifted to mirror the governments’ different priorities. The advancement of the automobile industry made sense during the industrial revolution, but today, this has been undercut by an urgency to protect the environment. Many strategies have been put in place to support this vision including an increase in parking meter prices, bike lanes being created on many streets and the establishment of ‘Limited Traffic Zones’ that give non-motorised road users more freedom and access to roads.

The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has and continues to marshal the transformation of Paris’s biking infrastructure in hopes of creating a “city of fifteen minutes”—or, Ville Du Quart D’Heure. With the execution of the Bike Plan – or Plan Velo – between 2015 and 2020, the city has invested 150 million euros in doubling the length of bike routes through several initiatives, involving the creation of an express  bike network – Réseau express vélo (REVe) with wide, two-way and protected lanes. To ensure coverage throughout the city, the city has developed a secondary network of three ringed roads to support the REVe.

For Act 2 of Plan Velo, Paris will continue to invest an additional 250 million euros into its biking infrastructure in order to achieve the ambitious goal of becoming a 100% cycling city. The plan details 180 kilometers of new segregated bike lanes and 180,000 new bike parking spots. In addition to added cycling facilities, the plan will transform car parking spots into bike parking and invest in maintenance of the bike infrastructure with cleaning and snow removal for cycling routes.
