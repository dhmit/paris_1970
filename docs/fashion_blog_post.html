Introduction 
</h2>

<p>
Paris is known as one of the fashion capitals of the world. The association of France and fashion began in the 17th century with Louis XIV’s court. Then, in the 1800s, department stores began to open in Paris, giving rise to Paris fashion. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the fashion industry exploded in France when Vogue was founded, and the first fashion houses were founded. In 1925, Coco Chanel revolutionized Paris fashion. Then, in the 1960s, the youth began to feel disillusioned with Paris fashion as they found it much too elegant and elaborate and instead wanted to dress more casually. 
</p>

<p>
The 1970s in Paris had countless fashion trends that stood out. One example is pants for women. Women began to wear pants outside more regularly, and many women even owned more formal pantsuits. Another new trend in the 1970s was the emergence of jeans. Although France wasn’t as big on denim as other places, jeans began to become more common with the younger generation. In our photo analysis, our goal is to see if these trends appeared in the photos and with what frequency.

<h2>
Photo Analysis
</h2>
<p>
To conduct our photo analysis, we first found around 50 photos that included people in them. Then, we analyzed each person in each photo and the clothes they were wearing. We separated age ranges into “child,” “young adult,” “adult,” and “elderly.” We also divided clothing items into categories like pants, shirt, jeans, jacket, suit jacket, dress, etc. From this, we hoped to find whether there were any patterns in what people were wearing either by gender or age and whether this related to trends in Paris fashion at the time. 
</p>

<p>
We found that the top 10 most common clothing items for males were pants, shirt, jacket, dress shirt, suit jacket, flat cap, shoes, dress shoes, blazer, and fedora. 
</p>

<p>
The top 10 most common clothing items for females were handbag, skirt, coat, jacket, shirt, trenchcoat, dress, ballerina flats, dress shoes, and knee high socks.
</p>

<p>
For children, we found that the top 10 most common clothing items were pants, shirt, shorts, blazer, vest, jacket, dress, hoodie, sweater, knee high socks.
</p>

<p>
The top clothing colors were black, white, blue, gray, brown, red, navy, beige, yellow, and purple, indicating that neutral colors were most commonly seen. 
</p>

<h3>
Jeans
</h3>
<p>
Breaking from the realm of work gear for the first time in 1950 as a symbol of countercultural rebelliousness, Jean rises in popularity and becomes gradually accepted as leisure wear. By 1970, jeans are making their way into part of the trendy, casual outfit. Although new to the wardrobe of casual-wears, jeans already appear on Parisien streets in 1970: 4.92% of people in photos observed are wearing jeans. Here is the distribution of age groups for the people observed in the photo to wear jeans:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adult - 66.67%</li>
    <li>Child - 16.67%</li>
    <li>Unsure - 16.67%</li>
    <li>Young Adult - 0%</li>
    <li>Elderly - 0%</li>
</ul>

<p>
As shown, jeans are found to belong primarily to the “Adult” age category, followed by the “Child” age category, while the “Elderly” and “Young adult” categories are not observed to wear jeans. The “Elderly” group will not be found to wear jeans in 1970 Paris as jeans were a statement of the younger generation’s rebelliousness, which the older generation likely disapproves of. It was strange that no jeans were found within the young adult age group. However, the 16.67% under the “Unsure” category may account for that, for young adults are often difficult to distinguish from adults or sometimes children—they are more likely to be labeled as “Unsure.” Our data, therefore, could be evidence that the new fashion trends are being adopted primarily by the younger population while the older population stuck to more traditional forms of dress.

<h3>
Skirts:
</h3>
<p>
Another notable new fashion trend from the time was the miniskirt, which became popular primarily among the younger population. From the data we collected, we found that a fourth of women were wearing some form of skirt. Then if we look at the percentage of women wearing a skirt per age group, we find the following results:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Young Adult: 50%</li>
    <li>Adult: 27.27%</li>
    <li>Child: 14.29%</li>
    <li>Elderly: 11%</li>
    <li>Unsure: 0%</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Just as in the jeans example, we find that a larger proportion of people assigned the “young adult” and “adult” categories have taken to the new trend, whereas the older portion of the population showed fewer signs of accepting it. The more traditional fashion at the time was more conservative, characterized by clothes like long layered dresses and long-sleeved plaid or solid collared shirts. From the data, dresses, for example, are worn by 44.44% of the “elderly” women and 54.55% of the “adult” women, while only 25% of the “young adult” women were wearing dresses, also a possible indication of them switching to newer trends. For men, the data also suggests the popularity of traditional fashion, such as plaid shirts and collared shirts, amongst the older population, with 28.57% of “elderly” men wearing the items as opposed to 18.18% of “young adult” men wearing them. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Elderly: 28.57%</li>
    <li>Adult: 23.81%</li>
    <li>Young Adult: 18.18%</li>
    <li>Child: 15.38%</li>
    <li>Unsure: Undefined</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Advertisements
</h3>
<p>
An extension of this photo analysis was looking at the fashion ads around Paris. Specifically, we looked at ads for Levi’s since jeans were a new fashion trend at the time. We found 4 Levi’s ads in photos taken around Paris. Each of the ads displayed the same image: a group of young people wearing Levi’s jeans. The ads were clearly targeted toward the younger generation, so perhaps not seeing as many “Young Adults” wearing jeans in our photo analysis was due to the subset of photos that we selected.

<h2>
Conclusions
</h2>
We generally found that people in Paris in the 1970s in the photos we analyzed tended to dress formally. This is likely because the more casual style trends, like jeans, hadn’t fully taken hold of Paris yet. We saw many men in suits and dress shoes in many different parts of Paris, including at playgrounds with their children. We also saw many women in skirts and suit jackets all over Paris. Although we did see some photos of more “out-there” fashion trends like denim suits, the more traditional formal fashion was most common.
