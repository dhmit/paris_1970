How does the frequency of construction in images of Paris in 1970 correlate to the change in population of the city in the 1970s?
</p>


<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
In the 1970s, the city of Paris underwent significant urban modernization, with giant high-rises towering over dilapidated brick skeletons. The goal of this research project is to investigate whether the frequency of construction in French photography in the 1970s correlates to an increase in population in a given arrondissement. 
</p>

<p>
The case study for this investigation is the 13th arrondissement (Figure 1). We observed the frequency of construction in a variety of photos from the C’était Paris en 1970 photography contest taken in the 13th arrondissement (Figure 2). Then, we studied census data for the population in the 13th arrondissement in 1968 and 1975 to observe the change of population in this arrondissement for this given period. We discovered that there is a high frequency of construction as captured in the photos, as well as an increase in population as reflected in the census data. Therefore, we concluded that there is a correlation between the frequency of construction in photos and the increase in population in the given arrondissement. There are several reasons for this correlation. Firstly, the high frequency of construction sites in the photos reflects how French photographers in the 1970s saw urban modernization as a defining characteristic of the city of Paris in 1970. Secondly, we observed from the photos that the purpose of construction can be residential, industrial or commercial, all of which can lead to an increase in population.

<h2>
Identifying Photos of Interest in the Database
</h2>

<p>
Our analysis can ultimately be broken up into a three-step process: combing through the photos in our database, detecting of trends in the census data, and identifying any patterns or correlations between the two.
</p>

<p>
Our initial browse of the photos database revealed that a large number of the photos contain signs of construction, ranging from construction cranes to bare scaffoldings to unfinished buildings (Figures 3 and 4). This repeated occurrence brought to our attention that photographers across map squares were identifying sites of construction as a common, and therefore, defining, feature of Paris in 1970.

<p>
With these observations, we can quantify construction density: we claim that a high frequency of construction sites in French photography correlates to a large amount of construction occurring throughout Paris. The conclusion of this relationship allows us to begin looking for photos with signs of construction, where construction is defined as either the building of a structure (construction) or the breaking down of a structure (destruction). We identified certain flags (such as construction cranes, support scaffolding, building skeletons, tools, and hardhats) as factors that distinguished photos that contain construction sites from those that do not. Using the similarities model developed by previous members of the Digital Humanities Lab, we discovered upwards of  40 photos for every 10 map squares that matched our definition of construction. The following is a sample of some of the other photos we found of the 13th arrondissement:

<p>
We started to consider the reasons for the high frequency of photos of construction and destruction in the 13th arrondissement. We believe that one of the main reasons for this common theme is that French photographers wished to capture the change in the urban landscape of Paris as a reflection of social, economic, political, and cultural change in France during the 1970s. 
</p>

<p>
In Figure 7, we can observe that there is a construction site at the bottom of the image, surrounded by older buildings converging along roads that meet in the middle of the image. Such images juxtaposing older buildings next to the construction of newer buildings was a common theme in images across map squares in the 13th arrondissement. These images capture the stark contrast between old and new Paris to represent the urban modernization of the city in the 1970s.
</p>

 

<p>
Furthermore, we observed that there was a significant number of images of destruction of older buildings, often with the purpose of clearing land for the construction of newer buildings. We considered such images to be of equal significance to images of construction as the destruction of old buildings is a defining characteristic of urban modernization in Paris in the 1970s. Even though the images of destruction leave room for the viewer to speculate the purpose of the destruction, we can conclude that the interest of photographers in scenes of destruction is rooted in a similar interest in the construction of newer buildings, both as symbols of urban renewal.
</p>

<p>
In the center of Figure 8, a dilapidated wall of a building is stained by signs of destruction, as can be seen through dark lines across an otherwise white wall. The wall is surrounded by rubble, presumably from the old building that used to share the same wall. The surrounding buildings all appear to be old, judging from the decolorization of their exterior. We can infer that the building was most likely destroyed to clear land for new construction. One way to interpret this image is that the photographer wished to represent Paris in 1970 through the destruction of old buildings, fueled by a wave of urban renewal sweeping across the city in the 1970s.
</p>

 

<p>
These photos taken of the 13th arrondissement, among many others, allowed us to conclude that there is a high frequency of photos containing construction sites. Therefore, we concluded that Paris in 1970 saw a large concentration of construction overall.
</p>


<h2>
Analyzing Population Change
<h2>

<p>
Our next step was to take note of trends in population changes. We claim that an increase in population indicates an influx of people due to factors that include a greater concentration of construction, and a decrease in population means an efflux of people due to those same factors. Furthermore, we attempted to provide several reasons for this correlation between population growth and construction density.
</p>


<p>
Since the C’était Paris en 1970 photography contest took place in 1970, determining trends following construction changes in that year meant sampling the census data of years prior to 1970, and the years that follow closely after. With that, we focused on available data from 1968 and 1975 and first analyzed the overarching changes in population statistics. There exists an upwards trend in population in the 13th arrondissement from 1968 to 1975, as we see a population growth of approximately 3.29% (see Figure 9).

<p>
There are several reasons to explain the correlation between construction density and population growth. Firstly, we observed that many buildings were constructed for residential purposes to accommodate an increase in population. In Figure 10, the buildings surrounding an empty lot appear to be newly constructed, which we inferred to be for residential purposes. On the left of the image, we can see what appear to be distinct units of apartments each with its own balcony. The surrounding buildings have a similar structure—the building in the background in the middle of the image appears to be an apartment complex, each window looks into different apartment units. Therefore, we can see that construction density has a direct correlation with population density because the construction of residential buildings can help accommodate the increase in population.

<h2>
Changes in Employment Sectors
</h2>

<p>
In addition to analyzing trends in population, we decided to observe the changes in employment sectors of the population in the 13th arrondissement to explore a different effect of construction density. Due to the highly subjective nature of our analysis, we cannot establish with full certainty our conclusion that there is a definite correlation between construction density and population change. Therefore, we decided to examine the effects of construction density on employment as a secondary reason for the frequency of construction in Paris in the 1970s.
</p>


<p>
For each arrondissement, we examined three categories, specifically the primary (agriculture), secondary (food, energy, the manufacturing of capital and consumer goods, engineering), and tertiary (tourism, transportation, general services) sectors. Below are results from the 13th arrondissement:

<p>
It is clear from these data points that there is an increase in the percentage of population employed in the tertiary sector in the 13th arrondissement. Therefore, we should expect to see a high frequency of images of construction for commercial purposes, such as the construction of new shops, restaurants, and shopping complexes. This observation is reasonable because it reflects the economic development of France in the 1970s, as the population shifts from employment in the secondary to tertiary sector (from the production of lower-value goods to the production of higher-value goods). Therefore, we can conclude that if the change in population cannot be attributed as a consequence of the high frequency of construction, we can see the secondary  effects of construction on the employment of the population for a given arrondissement.

<p>
In this image, we can observe that there is a row of shops on the ground floor looking out to a street lined with cars. In the bottom right of the image is a butcher’s shop, which we know from the sign on the shopfront (boucherie is the French word for butcher’s shop). Next to the butcher’s shop is a scaffold scaling the facade of the building, which could be for renovation purposes. We can reasonably infer that the building under construction—at least the unit on the ground floor facing the street—would be leased for commercial purposes, as the neighboring buildings have been. Such construction for commercial purposes reflects the change in employment of the population with a greater proportion employed in the tertiary sector. 
</p>


<p>
Even if there is no direct correlation between construction for non-residential purposes and population growth, we argue that the increase in commercial activity as depicted in many of the images does help to explain an increase in population. As more people move into a given arrondissement, there is a larger demand for goods and services, which will be met with an increase in supply as business owners seek to take advantage of newly enlarged markets of consumers. 
</p>


<h2>
Combining the Pieces
</h2>


<p>
With these analysis results from the photos from our database and the census data, we arrived at the conclusion that while there are other trends that we can extrapolate from the images (such as changes in employment sectors), we can observe that there is a positive correlation between the frequency of construction in the images of Paris in 1970 to population growth in the late 1960s and the early 1970s in a given arrondissement for several reasons. Firstly, the high frequency of construction in images of Paris in 1970 reflects the belief of photographers that construction was a defining characteristic of Paris and a physical manifestation of the economic, social, and political changes of the city. Secondly, we can observe a clear increase in the population of a given arrondissement that corresponds to the construction of new buildings, many of which appear to be for residential purposes. Thirdly, we address the question of the correlation between non-residential construction and population growth by showing that the economic effects of the construction of commercial buildings complement and bolster population growth.
