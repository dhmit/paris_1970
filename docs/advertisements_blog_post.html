    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
With the only constant of the 1970s being change, our project observes the French people’s beliefs and opinions through the lens of the advertisements and propaganda they plastered on the storefronts, billboards, and walls of their capital. While the 1970s was a tumultuous era of rebuilding from the old, people also tried their best to preserve their long standing traditions. Sifting through these advertisements and propaganda gives insight on what the Parisians were experiencing during the 1970s as the city around them changed.

The well known Levi Strauss & Co. was established in 1853 in the United States. The international division was established in 1965, and by 1971 the company had operations in 50 countries. While Paris was exposed to the brand in 1947, when it was showcased in the All-American fashion show in an effort to introduce American fashion to the city, it was around the 60s and 70s that Levi's Jeans were becoming more easily accessible to the Parisian public as retail stores started opening. This notion of accessibility is corroborated by the fact that the several Levi’s ads were found in Arrondissement 19, which is among the poorest regions of Paris. The implication of Levi’s marketing to these arrondissements is that the pants were affordable and accessible to its residents. Additionally, the high frequency of the Levi’s ad in these map squares implies that the Parisian public considers the then-120-year-old American jeans that were newly brought to Paris to be representative of the city in 1970. This idea is a testament to the role of globalization in turning Paris into an amalgamation of the new and old.

La Foire de Paris is the largest commercial fair in Paris, held annually during the spring and lasting about 10 days. The first one took place in 1904 in Le Marais, and it was held at a different location each year before settling down at le Porte de Versailles Exposition Center in 1925. The fair is organized into three broad categories (Wellbeing and Hobbies, Home, and World Cultures) and features domestic appliances, fashion, cultural products, food, workshops, entertainment for kids, interactive demos, contests, and other activities and goods for sale. This picture shows the banner for the 1970 Foire de Paris, which testifies its importance as one of the greatest retail events and speaks to the culture of consumerism in Paris.

<h3>
    BP 3 - Hospital Reform
</h3>

The announcement pictured is enclosed in a box with the acronym CDFT, which stands for the French Democratic Confederation of Labour. It declares that the hospital reform is dangerous for everyone, and that a meeting between local labor unions to advocate against it will take place in May. 1970 was an important year for the French Hospital system–on December 31st a law was passed that formally defined the public and private sector and introduced many new changes to the inner workings of the system at large. This poster tells us that the French were aware of the hospital reform in progress and that many were unhappy with it. Clearly, the French in 1970 were active citizens that unionized in order to have their voice heard by the government.

    BP 4 - Publicity Propaganda

This billboard illustrates the intersection between propaganda and publicity. Its title reads “Can you afford the luxury of being a “publicity-phobe” in 1970?”; and its subtitle “Publicity benefits those who trust it”. It speaks to the Parisian streets, media, and environment in the 70s: one without escape from advertisements. It tells us that some were concerned of losing Paris’ culture to consumerism, but this particular propaganda is in favor of the immense amount of publicity. It argues that advertisements are everywhere and practically inescapable, and that customers who receive them with an open mind gain more exposure to the variety of goods and services available to them.

    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
This evaluation of the advertisements and propaganda of Paris gives us insight on the political and cultural richness of the famous city. It is a testimony as to how Parisians sought to preserve historical traditions as well as change their communities for the better. Without the “This Was Paris in 1970”, it would have been difficult to see the everyday life of the Parisians in the 70s underneath French stereotypes from pop culture. In sum, what people choose to display on storefronts and the walls surrounding them says a lot about what they value.
