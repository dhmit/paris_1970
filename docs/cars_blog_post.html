The group’s research aimed at scouring through photographs of Paris in 1970, specifically photographs that  had cars in them. Primarily, the group wanted to pursue the traditional analytical way of conducting research hence few ideas such as determining people to car density ratio or car to map square ratio were considered. However, eventually the group decided to pursue a creative way with a mic of using some analytical skills to study the evolution of the automotive industry in Paris from its advent until 1970. The group also decided to research on the evolution of automotive paint simultaneously with the evolution of the automotive industry because of the variation in car colors over the years and how the 1970 Paris photographs backed up this observation.
</p>
<p>
The method used in transcribing these photographs involved using the current YOLO model to get all photographs with cars in them, and then afterwards these photos were manually transcribed by group members whereby, this led to the discovery in the differences of number of objects(cars) reported by the YOLO model in comparison to the actual number of cars in the photographs.

<h2>
Evolution of Automotive Industry in Paris(1769 - 1970)
</h2>

<p>
	The evolution of the French automotive industry started around 1769 when the French inventor, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot constructed the first ever steam engine in the automotive industry.He named this device, fadier à vapeur ,and proceeded to make larger versions of it in the following years but faced obstacles on the way such that some of the larger versions could not work because of some technical issues.
</p>
<p>
In the following years, more French inventors worked on developing different  internal combustion engines necessary for automobile operation.For instance, in 1807, the hydrogen powered internal combustion engine was developed by François Isaac de Rivaz, in 1850,an internal combustion machine that burned a mixture of coal gas and air was developed by Jean J. Lenoir and in 1884, Eduard Delamare-Deboutville built the first gasoline-powered automobile. By 1885, some inventors started manufacturing more steam powered vehicles like Amédée Bollée who manufactured at least 50 units of a steam powered vehicle that he built, called La Mancelle. The  La Mancelle is regarded as the first ever vehicle to be serially produced at that time.
</p>
<p>
By 1887, more inventors like Léon Serpollet engaged in building more steam powered vehicles like his predecessors. In the same year, René Panhard and Émile Levassor and established Panhard et Levassor,one of the first French motor vehicle manufacturers in France.This manufacturer sold its first car in 1890 based on Daimler engine license and from there, these first vehicles set many modern standards on cars.Cars made by Panhard took part in races and from 1895 to 1903, these cars won numerous races that were held.
</p>
<p>
Between 1887 to 1900, several motor vehicle manufacturers were established including Delahaye by Emile Delahaye,Les Fils de Peugeot Frères, which later became known as Peugeot, by Armand Peugot and Renault which was established by the Renault brothers,Louis,Marcel and Ferdinand.Most of these manufacturers were a result of starting out building singular vehicle projects and deciding to take the next step of actually selling the cars that they built.
</p>
<p>
Over the years until 1903, France remained the world’s leading automaker, producing nearly 49% of the world total vehicles.Between 1903 to 1920, more automakers were founded whereby  most of them  later on ceased production or merged with other companies.These companies were such as Hotchkiss et Cie founded in 1903, sold to Peugeot in 1950 and ceased production in 1955.Others were like Delage founded by Louis Delage in 1905 with a production end in 1954 after being bought by Delahaye in 1935.Bugatti founded in 1910 with its initial production ending in 1956.Hispano-Suiza founded in 1911 and ceases production in 1938.Avions Voisin founded by Gabriel Voisin in 1919.And finally, Citroën founded by Andre Citroën in 1919.
</p>
<p>
Most of the car automakers that were sold to other makers or ceased production experienced this as an aftermath of the World Wars.For instance, Delage was a luxury automaker hence post-World War II, production and selling statistics dropped due to lack of market. Bugatti’s Mosheim factory was left in ruins after World War II hence the ceased production.Hispano-Suiza was turned into an aircraft engine production maker post-World War II aligning with current needs as decided by the French government.While some cars were affected by the war negatively, some decided to take the opportunity to start manufacturing military vehicles that could be used in the war,one such company is Hotchkiss et Cie.
</p>
<p>
Between 1920 to 1950,more companies were established and by 1929, the French annual automobile production peaked at 253,000 passenger cars.However, In 1933,France lost its place to Great Britain and in 1936, it was in third place among Europe’s auto-producing countries with Germany taking its position.This was due to periods of destructive strikes and economic paralysis in France during the middle of the decade.
</p>
<p>
In the coming years ,between 1950 to 1970,more automakers were either established, assimilated into bigger automakers or ceased production.During this time some automakers such as Peugeot,Renault  and Citroën, showed resilience and dominance in the French automotive industry as they came up with new car models with improved functionality and makes. Most of the cars produced this time were salons hence passenger cars and some of these cars won awards like The Renault 16 which won the European car of the year in 1965, 504 manufactured by Peugeot won the same award in 1968 and the Citroën GS which won in 1970.
</p>
<p>
Hence, it can be observed that France, especially Paris, harbored among the biggest automotive industry plants in the world by 1970 hence making Paris among the areas that greatly contributed to the country’s economic growth at the time.

<h2>
Evolution of Automotive Paint
</h2>
<p>
Paints in automotive serve the purpose of protecting metal surfaces hence a range of paint products are used to achieve this.Around the 1900’s, paints were mainly composed of natural resins, mineral pigments, greasy varnish and solvents whereby paint was applied on cars using brushes until 1920. Around 1920, the paint gun was created and cellulosic resins included paints were developed.Hence during this period cars had a dry-ish look.Up until 1955, glyceropathic paints were introduced and at this time gloss could be obtained without polishing cars.Even though with the new developments,drying times were very long.Around 1970, synthetic paints were introduced and these paints had improved qualities in comparison to previous ones with shorter drying times.The films on cars as a result on using synthetic paints were hard, shiny, dry, resistant to solvent action and enabled repainting.The history of pigments used in paint can be summarized in the following table:

<h2>
Observations from the correlation of the Automotive industry and Automotive paint industry
</h2>

<p>
From the researched history of automotive paint and the automotive industry, we realized that most cars during this period would either be painted red or blue or silverish-white because of the dominance of pigments that created these colors during the period specifically before 1970, But the coming of synthetic paints around 1970 also opened up possibilities of cars being painted another colors other than the dominant three colors and this was exactly the result obtained when we transcribed photographs of cars whereby we noticed that most cars were either painted in red or blue or silver with a few cars painted in other colors hence the creation of synthetic paints around 1970 brought forth a greater range of colors in cars and in the city where the cars were.


<p>
The YOLO (you only look once) model’s usefulness lies in its efficiency in extracting large quantities of data compared to a manual approach to gathering information. As a result, the YOLO model has been useful in the creation of the “This Was Paris 1970'' website, especially due to its ability to allow for the creation of object detection tags.

<p>
Still, with the cursory glance the model takes at the photos, it is possible to have incorrect results. To analyze the model’s object detection capabilities, our team took the time to analyze the photos by hand to identify, if possible, three main traits of cars in photographs: whether or not the car was roofed, its color, and the number of cars we could clearly count in the photographs. With the number of photos marked as having cars being over 2,000, we decided to limit the scope to photos the model identified as having a single car, which was still 452 photos. A more convincing justification for restricting the number of photos, however, was that it would be easier to identify if the YOLO model was incorrect with a quick glance. For example, the photo was of a packed parking lot, but the number of cars the model detected was one, then it would take minimal effort to identify the photo as having been incorrectly analyzed by the model.

<p>
Apart from the significant time it took to analyze the photos, gathering information from hand presented other challenges. Especially with regards to how to classify cars, there were ambiguous cases that were difficult to categorize for two of the three particular traits we were analyzing: the color of cars and the number of cars.
</p>

<h3>
Colors of cars
</h3>
<p>
There was the issue of distinguishing between subtle color differences. The distances of cars from the photographers varied with a wide range of photographs taken for the “This Was Paris 1970” photo contest. While some photos had unambiguously red or white cars, many photos had cars in the distance that blended in with the environment to the extent that identifying the exact color was difficult. Furthermore, although the majority of cars which were cataloged had simple colors such as blue, black and, white, there was a spectrum of colors found in photographs that were difficult to reflect. Cyan and cream are a few examples of car colors found that did not entirely fit in perfectly with the categories of cars classified as blue or brown. While the YOLO model currently does not have the ability to identify cars, one possibility is that in the future the hex number for the color can be recorded as a more systematic way of labeling colors. Yet, another problem still remains that might make even this methodical approach fall short. Several cars were in the shadow of buildings, which posed a problem for those that were darker colored. The most common pair of colors that shadows made difficult to distinguish were blue and black.
</p>

	
<h3>
Number of cars
</h3>
<p>
The YOLO model did not always accurately determine the correct number of cars in each image. In order to transcribe more efficiently, we decided to only analyze and record data on the images that the model identified as having a single car. Under the “Number Of Cars” field, we would simply indicate whether the reported number of cars was correct or not. If it was correct, we would then proceed to transcribe (recording data about color, etc). If not, we would simply skip.
